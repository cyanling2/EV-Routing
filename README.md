# EV-Routing
EV-Routing is an Android navigation app for electric vehicles which aims to solve EV users' range anxieties.
## Description
One major reason that prevents electric vehicles, one of the ways to move towards a more sustainable environment, to be widely adopted is the range anxiety. According to studies by visualcapitalist and EVBOX, the average EV range is 211 miles, which is only half of what a gas car can cover. While there are about 3,000,000 electric cars in the United States, there are only 20,431 level 3 chargers (level 3 charger, AKA DC fast & supercharger, provides 400-900 volts and charges at 3-20 miles per minute). Sources of the above data are listed in `Sources`.People are generally worried that their electric vehicles may run out of battery in the middle of a long trip while they can not find a fast charger nearby. The EV-Routing app aims to solve this problem by providing a route planning service that takes charging problems into consideration for EV users. The app should be able to plan a route that finds compatible charging stations as intemediate points efficiently based on the destination and vehicle information provided by the user. Tesla has a similar app embedded in its built-in navigation system which serves tesla users only. This app aims to provide a more general solution that help users of other brands as well.
## Installation
1. Download and install Android Studio. https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Clone the repo to your `AndroidStudioProjects` folder. For Windows users, by default it should be at \
`C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AndroidStudioProjects`.
3. Open the code repository from Android Studio. Include your sdk direction in your local.properties file `sdk.dir={your direction}`.
You can do so from UI as well:
